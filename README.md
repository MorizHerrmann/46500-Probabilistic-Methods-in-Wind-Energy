### Some Links that I found helpful:
##### How to install tensorflow:
- https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/
But sometimes there are issues.
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46568913/tensorflow-import-error-no-module-named-tensorflow
Maybe it works better to use the example environment from the DL exercise.

### Some good introductions:
A very narrative introduction about the theoretical background.
- http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/
A well documented example code that might help us.
